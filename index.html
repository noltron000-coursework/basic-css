			In mathematics, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octonion">octonions</a> are a normed division algebra over the real numbers, meaning it is a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercomplex_numberzzz" title="Hypercomplex number">hypercomplex</a></em>; Octonions are usually represented by the capital letter "<strong>O</strong>", using boldface "<b>O</b>" or blackboard "<span class="blackboard">&#120134;</span>". Octonions have eight dimensions; twice the number of dimensions of the quaternions, of which they are an extension. They are noncommutative and nonassociative, but satisfy a weaker form of associativity; namely, they are alternative.
